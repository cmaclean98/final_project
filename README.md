<h3>Overview<h3/>
This map was inspired by the growing housing crisis in New York and the Peterson Rich 9x18 (link: http://www.pro-arch.com/projects/9x18project). By utilizing data from Google Maps, the New York City Department of Transportation, and the New York City Department of City Planning, we can focus in on one area as a measure for underutilized parking land that could instead house New Yorkers. 

<h3>Methodology<h3/>
This map was created using Google Maps (link: https://www.google.com/maps) available parking facilities and NYC DOT (link: https://nycdotsigns.net) street parking zones within William/Fulton/Water/Maiden Lane streets in Lower Manhattan.
