<h3>Overview<h3/>
This map was inspired by the growing housing crisis in New York and the Peterson Rich 9x18 http://www.pro-arch.com/projects/9x18project. By utilizing data from Google Maps, the New York City Department of Transportation, and the New York City Department of City Planning, we can focus in on one area as a measure for underutilized parking land that could instead house New Yorkers. 

<h3>Methodology<h3/>
This map was created using Google Maps https://www.google.com/maps available parking facilities and NYC DOT https://nycdotsigns.net/-74.01008677455299:40.70613083657989,-74.01008677455299:40.70948343102711,-74.003934083757:40.70948343102711,-74.003934083757:40.70613083657989,-74.01008677455299:40.70613083657989/parking,21/639 street parking zones within William/Fulton/Water/Maiden Lane streets in Lower Manhattan.
