            It is a uncontested truth that land within the five boroughs of NYC is precious.
            <p>
                However, how much of this land is dedicated to parking lots? <b>According to the New York City
                    Economic Development Corporation, only 22% of New Yorkers own cars. And yet, according to <i>Too
                        Many Cars</i>
                    NYC, there are 5,375,612 parking spaces across the five boroughs. That's over 480,000,000 square
                    feet of just curbside parking based on the standard 9x18 spot size.</b>

                With vast improvements and access to public transit and a growing housing crisis, the city must
                prioritize housing development. As public officials consider strategies to meet growing housing
                demand through a variety of housing typologies and funding sources, it is imperative to examine
                the areas that contain an exhorbinant amount of parking. This map presents a case study of a few
                blocks of Manhattan's central business district, bound by Pearl Street to the East, William
                Street to the West, Fulton Street to the North, and Maiden Lane to the South. According to NYC DCP
                street widths,
                the case study zone represents roughly 4500 square feet. In the spirit of the Peterson Rich Office
                <i>9x18</i> project, just 2 parking spaces can equal a micro unit and 2.5 can equate to a 1-bedroom
                apartment. There is ample opportunity to build housing in this central business hub.
                The area is transit-rich-situated directly adjacent to a plethora of subway stops (namely Wall Street,
                Fulton Street Broad Street, and Cortlandt), bus routes, and Citi Bike stations.
